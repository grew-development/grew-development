Hey there ðŸ‘‹,<br>
I'm Grewo alias @grew-development (Sven RÃ¶nnfranz).<br>
Since April 2025, Iâ€™ve been publishing my scripts under the name "Grew Solutions".<br>
However, grew-development will remain active here on GitHub, as itâ€™s the most convenient and organized way for me to manage my repositories.

Since several years I started to use HTML-codes, PHP-codes and CSS to design my own homepages.

A few years ago I started to work with LUA, C# and many other programming languages.

Meanwhile I have over fifteen own reposetories, which are offered for sale on my homepage.<br>
Exclusively only FiveM scripts...

I was inspired for this Github repository by [@Redacks](https://github.com/redacks).<br>
They have already inspired me in a few things, as we both have recently been exchanging a lot about programming,<br>
Github and everything that goes with it.

If you have further questions feel free to contact me.
